Steps to Improve Response Time
1. Batch Queries for Vector Search
Instead of searching for every query individually, you can precompute embeddings or batch the embedding generation to reduce latency.

2. Reduce Vector Store Retrieval Size
Set the k parameter (number of top results to retrieve) to a reasonable value (e.g., k=3) rather than fetching a large number of results.

3. Optimize Vector Store Backend
For vector stores, ensure:

Indexes are optimized (e.g., use approximate nearest neighbor methods like HNSW).
The database is on a high-performance infrastructure.
4. Use Faster Embedding Models
Switch to a faster embedding model (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002) if possible.

5. Cache Embeddings
Precompute embeddings for static queries/documents and store them. This avoids redundant embedding computation.

6. Optimize LLM Calls
Reduce the token size of input by trimming retrieved documents or using a summary chain.
Use a smaller model (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo) if high accuracy isnâ€™t required.

7. Enable Asynchronous Execution
Run vector search and LLM inference in parallel or asynchronously.

Optimized Code Example
"""
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
import asyncio

# 1. Use a Faster Embedding Model
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-ada-002")  # Faster and cost-effective

# 2. Initialize Vector Store
vector_store = FAISS.load_local("path_to_faiss_store", embeddings)

# 3. Optimize Retriever with a Lower 'k' Value
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3})  # Fetch fewer top results

# 4. Define a Custom Prompt to Reduce Input Token Size
prompt_template = """
You are a helpful assistant. Answer the user's question concisely based on the provided documents.

Documents: {context}

Question: {question}
Answer:

prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["context", "question"], template=prompt_template)

# 5. Initialize Chat Model (Smaller Model for Faster Responses)
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")  # Use smaller model if speed > accuracy

# 6. Build RetrievalQA Chain with Optimized Settings
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=retriever,
    chain_type="stuff",
    chain_type_kwargs={"prompt": prompt},
    return_source_documents=False  # Skip returning sources to save processing time
)

# 7. Asynchronous Query Handling
async def query_qa_chain_async(query: str):
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    response = await loop.run_in_executor(None, qa_chain.run, query)
    return response

# Query Example
async def main():
    query = "What is the content of the first email?"
    response = await query_qa_chain_async(query)
    print("Response:", response)

# Run the Async Query
asyncio.run(main())

"""
Detailed Improvements in the Code
Batch Processing with Async:

The query_qa_chain_async function runs the query in an asynchronous executor, allowing you to parallelize multiple user queries.
Reduced Retrieval Size (k):

Set k=3 for the retriever to fetch only the top 3 relevant results. Increase k if needed but keep it low to reduce computation.
Faster Embedding Model:

Switched to text-embedding-ada-002 for faster embedding generation without compromising too much on quality.
Smaller LLM:

Switched to gpt-3.5-turbo, which is faster and cheaper than gpt-4. If accuracy is critical, you can stick with gpt-4.
Concise Prompts:

The prompt is designed to include only the most relevant context ({context}), reducing token usage and LLM processing time.
Precomputed Embeddings:

If documents are static, embeddings can be precomputed during initialization and reused for all queries, avoiding repetitive computation.

Advanced Optimization: Use Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)
If your vector store supports it (e.g., FAISS with HNSW), enable approximate nearest neighbor search for faster retrieval:
"""
from faiss import IndexHNSWFlat

# Create an HNSW index for faster retrieval
dimension = 1536  # Depends on the embedding model
index = IndexHNSWFlat(dimension, 32)  # 32 is the number of connections
vector_store = FAISS(index, embeddings.embed_query, "your_faiss_store")
