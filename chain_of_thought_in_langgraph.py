"""
ðŸ§© LangGraph Version (Chain of Thought / React as Nodes)
In LangGraph, you'd define nodes like:

Reason

(Optionally) Tool Use

Update Memory / Repeat

A simplified pseudo-code (actual LangGraph requires graph creation with nodes):
"""

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

def reasoning_node(state):
    # Generate reasoning
    print("Thinking step by step...")
    return add_messages(state, "Thought: Let's solve the problem step by step.")

def final_answer_node(state):
    return add_messages(state, "Final Answer: ...")

# Build the graph
graph = StateGraph()

graph.add_node("reason", reasoning_node)
graph.add_node("final", final_answer_node)
graph.set_entry_point("reason")
graph.add_edge("reason", "final")
graph.set_finish_point("final")

# Execute
app = graph.compile()
app.invoke({})

# You'd insert LangChain tools, LLMs, or memory handlers at each stage.
