Creating a prompt that encourages a model to use a chain of thought reasoning process involves explicitly asking it to break down its answer into a series of logical steps. Here is an example of a Chain of Thought (CoT) prompt:

Example 1: Simple Arithmetic Chain of Thought
Prompt: Q: If there are 3 apples and you buy 4 more apples, how many apples do you have in total? Explain step by step.

Expected Chain of Thought Answer:

Start with the initial number of apples: 3 apples.
Add the number of apples you bought: 3 + 4 = 7 apples.
Therefore, the total number of apples is 7.
Example 2: Reasoning with Real-World Information
Prompt: Q: Tom has 8 marbles, and he gives 3 marbles to Jerry. Then, Tom buys 5 more marbles. How many marbles does Tom have now? Explain step by step.

Expected Chain of Thought Answer:

Tom initially has 8 marbles.
Tom gives 3 marbles to Jerry: 8 - 3 = 5 marbles.
Tom then buys 5 more marbles: 5 + 5 = 10 marbles.
Therefore, Tom now has 10 marbles.
Example 3: Complex Logical Reasoning
Prompt: Q: If a train leaves Station A at 3 PM traveling at 60 miles per hour and another train leaves Station B at 4 PM traveling at 90 miles per hour towards Station A, when will the two trains meet if the distance between the stations is 300 miles? Explain your reasoning step by step.

Expected Chain of Thought Answer:

Let’s calculate the distance traveled by the first train in 1 hour: 60 miles per hour × 1 hour = 60 miles.
The remaining distance between the two trains when the second train starts is: 300 miles - 60 miles = 240 miles.
The combined speed of the two trains is: 60 miles per hour + 90 miles per hour = 150 miles per hour.
Time taken for the trains to meet after the second train starts is: 240 miles ÷ 150 miles per hour = 1.6 hours.
1.6 hours is equivalent to 1 hour and 36 minutes.
Since the second train starts at 4 PM, they will meet at 5:36 PM.
Example 4: General Knowledge and Reasoning
Prompt: Q: Why do we have seasons on Earth? Explain step by step.

Expected Chain of Thought Answer:

The Earth is tilted on its axis by about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the Sun.
As the Earth orbits the Sun, this tilt causes different parts of the Earth to receive varying amounts of sunlight at different times of the year.
When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it experiences summer because it receives more direct sunlight.
Conversely, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, it experiences winter because it receives less direct sunlight.
The Southern Hemisphere experiences the opposite seasons at the same time.
Therefore, the tilt of the Earth's axis and its orbit around the Sun are the reasons why we have seasons.
Structuring a Chain of Thought Prompt
When designing your own chain of thought prompts, follow these principles:

Ask for Step-by-Step Reasoning: Encourage the model to think systematically and explain each step.
Provide Context: Ensure the model understands the background information or relevant constraints.
Explicitly Mention a Chain of Thought Process: Use language like “Explain step by step” or “Reason through this systematically.”
You can use these structures to guide the model's thinking for various types of questions, from simple arithmetic to complex reasoning tasks.
