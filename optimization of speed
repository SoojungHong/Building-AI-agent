"""
To improve the response time of your GPT-based chatbot in a Streamlit application, here are several strategies you can implement:

1. Optimize GPT API Usage
Request Smaller Models: If you’re using OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, consider switching to a smaller and faster model like GPT-3.5, especially if the task doesn't require the depth of GPT-4.
Use Tokens Efficiently: Ensure that the prompt and context you send to the API are minimal and efficient. Trimming unnecessary parts of the conversation history can significantly reduce latency.
Context Management: Limit the number of conversation turns that you send with each API call. Consider truncating or summarizing earlier parts of the conversation to reduce the prompt size.
Batch Requests: If you're making multiple API calls or parallel processing, ensure that the requests are sent efficiently (e.g., batching similar requests, reducing network overhead).
2. Streamlit Performance Optimization
Async API Calls: Streamlit allows you to use asyncio to make asynchronous API calls. This helps avoid blocking the main thread while waiting for the GPT API to respond, improving the perceived performance.
"""

import asyncio
import streamlit as st

async def get_response_from_api(prompt):
    # Async call to GPT API here
    return response

async def main():
    prompt = st.text_input("Ask something:")
    if prompt:
        response = await get_response_from_api(prompt)
        st.write(response)

asyncio.run(main())


"""
Streamlit Caching: If your chatbot needs to fetch the same responses for repeated queries, use Streamlit’s built-in caching mechanism (st.cache_data()). It can reduce the need to call the API again for the same request.
"""
@st.cache_data
def get_cached_response(prompt):
    # Your GPT API call here
    return response


"""
3. Improve Network Latency
Use Faster Hosting for Backend: If you're hosting the GPT model or using the API via a hosted environment, ensure that the backend is hosted on a low-latency, high-bandwidth platform (such as AWS, GCP, or Azure) that is close to the region where your Streamlit app is hosted.
WebSocket Communication: If possible, switch to WebSockets instead of HTTP for API communication. WebSockets allow persistent, full-duplex communication channels, which can improve the efficiency of requests and responses.
4. Reduce Token Processing Time
Streaming Responses: Enable token-by-token streaming in your GPT API responses. This allows your Streamlit app to start displaying the response as it's generated, reducing the wait time for long responses.
OpenAI API allows for token streaming, so you can use it in Streamlit like this:
"""
import openai
import streamlit as st

def generate_response(prompt):
    response = ""
    for chunk in openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100,
        stream=True  # Enable streaming
    ):
        response += chunk['choices'][0]['text']
        st.write(response)
    return response

"""
5. Backend Preprocessing or Postprocessing
Precompute Frequently Asked Queries: For frequently asked questions (FAQs), precompute and cache responses so the system doesn't need to call the API for common queries.
Server-side Computation: If using Streamlit in a client-server architecture, ensure heavy computation is done server-side rather than client-side to improve efficiency.
6. Resource Monitoring and Scaling
API Rate Limits: Make sure you aren’t hitting any API rate limits, which can delay responses. If necessary, consider upgrading to higher tiers for faster throughput.
Autoscaling: If you’re running this chatbot on your own servers, ensure that the server resources (CPU, memory) are sufficient and automatically scaled as needed.
7. Timeouts and Error Handling
Implement timeouts and error handling to retry API calls or give immediate feedback if the service is delayed.
By combining these strategies, you can significantly reduce the response time of your chatbot, improving user experience. If you need more help with a specific strategy, feel free to ask!
